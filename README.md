# Whiskey-Classification

When it comes to alcoholic beverages, consumers like to be adventurous. We decide what we like to drink based on our flavor preferences and budget, and it can be inefficient and expensive to try many options over time. 

This project will attempt to classify different whiskies by their type. We can classify whiskies by different features, such as their mash bill, the region they were manufactured, and their flavor profile. The end user can try new whiskey recommendations with some guidance from this model without going through the exhaustive trial-and-error process of finding a new brand to try.
